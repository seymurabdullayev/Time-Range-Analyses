# Time-Range-Analyses
Power BI project showcasing time-based analysis of business metrics with slicers, bookmarks, and dynamic visuals.

## Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that enables users to perform comprehensive time-based analysis of business performance. By leveraging simulated sales and transaction data, the dashboard provides valuable insights into:

- Overall performance metrics such as total sales, total profit, total orders, and order quantity.
- Time range comparisons including daily sales, monthly transactions and sales, and quarterly transaction trends.
- Geographical insights such as total sales by city profitability, top 3 cities by transactions, and detailed location-based analysis.
- Business trends over time, helping users identify peak sales days, profitable regions, and seasonal or quarterly changes.

The dashboard is designed not only for a specific industry but for any business or organization seeking to analyze operational data over different time ranges. Its interactivity (slicers, bookmarks) allows users to drill down into details, compare results across periods, and explore patterns in an intuitive way.
